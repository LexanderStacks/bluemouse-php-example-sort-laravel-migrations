Usage to check the program:
1.) Create a Root Folder
2.) Copy and Paste Your Laravel Project "migrations" folder inside the root folder
3.) Run the PHP Index Script by typing Your local URL the way You test PHP Projects local (with the name of Your root project)

=> Return: The program sorts all migration files alphabetically and removes the "add_some_columns_to_these_table"-files. 

There will be just "create"-Migration files left. It shortens Your Migration Files and brings an order and clear overview about Your Laravels project database structure.
